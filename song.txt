Woke up early, grabbed my books,
Gonna hit those lessons, take a look.
Math and science, history too,
So much knowledge, so much to do.

Though it’s tough, and the days are long,
With every challenge, we grow strong.
Every page turned, every note,
Learning’s a journey, let’s stay afloat.

Learn and grow, every day,
Knowledge is the light that shows the way.
Dreams are built with what we know,
So let’s learn and grow, let’s learn and grow.

Though it’s tough, and the days are long,
With every challenge, we grow strong.
Every test faced, every goal,
Knowledge fills the mind, and soul.
